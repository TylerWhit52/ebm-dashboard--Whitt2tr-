## Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

### High Influence, High Interest (Manage Closely)
- **Team Executives, League Officials, Player Associations**  
  League officials and governing bodies (they have the authority to enforce changes and a strong interest in protecting the sport’s reputation) and players’ unions (they wield collective bargaining power and are highly invested in athlete welfare).

### High Influence, Low Interest (Keep Satisfied)
- **Sponsors, Brand Partners,Team owners**  
  *They hold significant decision-making power but may show lower interest in oversight reforms unless their own autonomy or profits are affected. Update regularly on reform outcomes and compliance wins to maintain confidence*
owner specific- Team Owners: Introduce changes gradually and offer practical support to reduce any burden – for example, 
phased implementation of compliance requirements and adoption of technology tools to automate and simplify
 oversight tasks. This approach shows owners that oversight can coexist with operational efficiency and won’t cripple their autonomy overnight

### Low Influence, High Interest (Keep Informed)
- **Athletes, Medical Staff, Advocacy Groups**  
  *Provide transparent updates, offer participation in feedback surveys or forums*
athlete specific- Work through the players’ union to involve athletes in the reform process,
 and provide safe channels (like anonymous grievance hotlines) for players to report malpractice 
 without fear of retaliation.

### Low Influence, Low Interest (Monitor)
- **General Public, Non-sports media**  
  *Monitor perception trends and address concerns only when issues go viral or generate attention*
Media/fan specific-Proactively share transparency reports and success stories. Publicizing the organization’s commitment to athlete welfare (e.g. regular updates on safety improvements and financial education programs) will reassure sponsors and fans, strengthening the brand and fan loyalty by showing that the sport is being managed with integrity.
By tailoring messages and incentives in this way, each stakeholder is more likely to buy into the oversight initiative based on their interests and concerns.”*

## Key Stakeholder Insights for Evidence Collection

### Who to Interview/Survey
- Professional athletes (retired and active)
- Agents and team compliance officers
- Union representatives (e.g., NFLPA, NBPA)
- Medical professionals associated with sports teams
- League officials and executive managers

### What Questions to Ask
- To athletes: "Have you ever experienced or witnessed management malpractice? What were the consequences?"
- To agents: "What safeguards do you believe protect athletes from poor management decisions?"
- To unions/leagues: "What systems are currently in place for ethical oversight? Are they effective?"
- To medical staff: "Have you felt pressured to clear athletes prematurely or hide injuries?"
- To sponsors: "How do scandals involving athletes influence your brand decisions?"

### How to Engage
- **Athletes:** Anonymous surveys, union focus groups
- **Agents/Managers:** Confidential interviews or ethics questionnaires
- **Leagues/Unions:** Formal requests for policy documents or interviews
- **Medical staff:** Interviews under confidentiality protections
- **Sponsors:** Brand reputation surveys or executive interviews

#Stakeholder conflicts
Several stakeholder groups are likely to resist aspects of the oversight initiative, each for specific reasons. Team owners and leagues may worry 
about the costs of implementing vetting and audit systems and the administrative burden of compliance paperwork. They could also fear that stricter oversight might create competitive 
disadvantages (for instance, if some teams adapt more slowly than others) and increase liability exposure by documenting problems that could lead to legal action. Agents and managers might resist 
because tighter regulations and transparency in financial dealings could threaten their income streams, especially if they have been benefitting from opaque fee structures. In contrast, players 
strongly desire protection and oversight, while some team executives prioritize autonomy – this fundamental tension between athlete welfare and management control is at the heart of the conflict.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Be specific about each stakeholder group's interests and influence
2. Consider both obvious and hidden stakeholders
3. Think about implementation challenges from stakeholder perspectives
4. This analysis will guide your stakeholder evidence collection
