# Scientific Evidence: Methods & Acquisition Strategy

## Research Question

This investigation pursued two interconnected research questions designed to establish both the scope of management malpractice and potential solutions. The primary question examined what the academic literature reveals about the long-term impacts of financial and health-related mismanagement on professional athletes, focusing on quantifiable outcomes such as bankruptcy rates, career longevity, and post-retirement health status. The secondary question investigated what interventions or reformsincluding financial literacy programs, medical oversight protocols, and agent regulation mechanismshave been empirically shown to reduce post-career risk for professional athletes. Together, these questions frame both the problem severity and the evidence base for potential solutions.

## Search Strategy

The literature search employed a systematic multi-database approach to ensure comprehensive coverage of both medical and business literature related to athlete welfare. The search spanned six major academic databases: Google Scholar for broad interdisciplinary coverage, Business Source Premier for management and financial literature, PubMed/MEDLINE for health outcomes research, SSRN for working papers and emerging research, JSTOR for established social science journals, and supplementary access through the JMU Library proxy for subscription-restricted content. This database selection strategy ensured capture of both peer-reviewed empirical studies and recent working papers that might not yet appear in traditional journals.

The keyword strategy employed both primary and secondary search terms to balance specificity with comprehensiveness. Primary keywords targeted the core problem domain: "professional athlete financial literacy," "concussion outcomes retired NFL," "management malpractice sports," "long-term athlete health outcomes," and "financial fragility NFL." Secondary keywords expanded the search to related concepts: "sports management ethics," "career transition athletes," "independent oversight sports," "agent misconduct NFL," and "athlete exploitation." Boolean search combinations systematically connected these termsfor example, ("financial literacy" AND "professional athletes"), ("sports concussion" AND "retired NFL"), and ("management malpractice" OR "agent misconduct") AND ("professional athletes")to identify studies examining the intersection of management practices and athlete outcomes.

Search filters refined results to ensure relevance and quality. The date range of 20132023 captured the most recent decade of research while excluding outdated studies that might not reflect current management practices or medical knowledge. Language restrictions limited results to English to ensure accurate interpretation, while study type filters prioritized peer-reviewed empirical studies employing quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods approaches. Geographic scope focused primarily on U.S. professional sports, with selective inclusion of European and Canadian studies for comparative context. Industry focus concentrated on major professional sports leaguesespecially the NFL given its prominence in malpractice discussionswhile including NBA, MLB, and general elite athletics literature when relevant to the research questions.

## Selection Criteria

Study inclusion and exclusion criteria were designed to ensure focus on empirical evidence directly relevant to professional athlete management and welfare outcomes. Inclusion criteria prioritized studies analyzing financial, health, or career management practices affecting professional athletes, with emphasis on research reporting empirical data (quantitative outcomes preferred over qualitative). Studies conducted within professional sports organizations or involving cohorts of retired or active professional athletes received priority, as did peer-reviewed journal articles and credible institutional reports. Final inclusion required explicit reporting of effect sizes, measurable outcomes, or quantifiable results that could be compared across studies.

Exclusion criteria removed studies lacking direct relevance or sufficient rigor. Studies examining non-professional athlete populationsparticularly those focused solely on amateur or college athleteswere excluded to maintain focus on the professional context where malpractice dynamics differ significantly. Articles presenting only opinion, editorial commentary, or other non-empirical content were excluded regardless of topic relevance. Non-English language articles were excluded to ensure accurate interpretation and comparison across the evidence base. Duplicate publications, inaccessible studies (even with institutional proxy access), and studies where relevance remained ambiguous after abstract review were also excluded.

## Challenges and Limitations

The scientific evidence acquisition process encountered several important limitations that shaped both the scope and certainty of findings. The evidence base itself presented a fundamental constraint: few rigorous randomized controlled trials or systematic meta-analyses directly addressed athlete management topics, forcing reliance on observational studies and single-site investigations with lower internal validity. Access barriers compounded this challengemany promising studies remained trapped behind journal paywalls, accessible only through the JMU Library proxy, while niche sports law and management journals required institutional subscriptions the university did not maintain. Thematic concentration created additional bias: studies focused overwhelmingly on NFL populations and concussion outcomes, while evidence from NBA, MLB, or European football remained sparse, potentially limiting generalizability to the broader professional sports context.

Resource constraints further shaped the evidence gathering process. The time available to comprehensively screen all results from broad search terms proved insufficient, forcing prioritization of high-relevance results rather than exhaustive review. Several promising articles that might have contributed relevant data remained inaccessible despite thorough proxy searching. Topic-specific terminology challenges added interpretive complexitykey concepts like "financial fragility," "literacy gaps," and "management accountability" lacked consistent definitions across disciplines, requiring careful cross-study comparison. Perhaps most significantly, the literature itself reflected a research bias toward problem description: many studies documented that mismanagement occurs and produces negative outcomes, but far fewer provided empirical evaluation of specific interventions or reforms that might mitigate risk. This gap meant that while the evidence strongly validates the problem scope (X), it provides comparatively weaker empirical grounding for solution effectiveness (Y).
