# Scientific Evidence: Methods & Acquisition Strategy
## Research Question

**Primary Research Question:**  
What does the academic literature reveal about the long-term impacts of financial and health-related mismanagement of professional athletes?

**Secondary Research Question:**  
What interventions or reforms (e.g., financial literacy, medical oversight, agent regulation) have been empirically shown to reduce post-career risk for professional athletes?

## Documentation Process

### Reference Management
- Manual logging of all citations in APA format  
- Google Docs master table with relevance/quality columns

### Evidence Extraction Form
For each study, I documented:
- Full citation (APA)  
- Research design  
- Population/sample  
- Country/setting  
- Key findings  
- Effect sizes (if provided)  
- Relevance to X (problem) and Y (solution)  
- Any limitations or bias

## Challenges and Limitations

### Search Limitations
- Few RCTs or meta-analyses specific to athlete management topics  
- Limited access to niche sports law journals without full subscription  
- NFL-focused studies dominated; fewer in NBA, MLB, or European football

### Resource Constraints
- Time limit to screen broad terms thoroughly  
- Some promising articles lacked full access despite university tools

### Topic-Specific Challenges
- Terminology was inconsistent across disciplines (e.g., “financial fragility” vs “literacy gaps”)  
- Many studies focused on problem descriptions, not interventions or outcomes
