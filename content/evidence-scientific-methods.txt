# Scientific Evidence: Methods & Acquisition Strategy

## Research Question

This investigation pursued two interconnected research questions designed to establish both the scope of management malpractice and potential solutions. The primary question examined what the academic literature reveals about the long-term impacts of financial and health-related mismanagement on professional athletes, focusing on quantifiable outcomes such as bankruptcy rates, career longevity, and post-retirement health status. The secondary question investigated what interventions or reformsincluding financial literacy programs, medical oversight protocols, and agent regulation mechanismshave been empirically shown to reduce post-career risk for professional athletes. Together, these questions frame both the problem severity and the evidence base for potential solutions.

## Search Strategy

The literature search employed a systematic multi-database approach to ensure comprehensive coverage of both medical and business literature related to athlete welfare. The search spanned six major academic databases: Google Scholar for broad interdisciplinary coverage, Business Source Premier for management and financial literature, PubMed/MEDLINE for health outcomes research, SSRN for working papers and emerging research, JSTOR for established social science journals, and supplementary access through the JMU Library proxy for subscription-restricted content. This database selection strategy ensured capture of both peer-reviewed empirical studies and recent working papers that might not yet appear in traditional journals.

The keyword strategy employed both primary and secondary search terms to balance specificity with comprehensiveness. Primary keywords targeted the core problem domain: "professional athlete financial literacy," "concussion outcomes retired NFL," "management malpractice sports," "long-term athlete health outcomes," and "financial fragility NFL." Secondary keywords expanded the search to related concepts: "sports management ethics," "career transition athletes," "independent oversight sports," "agent misconduct NFL," and "athlete exploitation." Boolean search combinations systematically connected these termsfor example, ("financial literacy" AND "professional athletes"), ("sports concussion" AND "retired NFL"), and ("management malpractice" OR "agent misconduct") AND ("professional athletes")to identify studies examining the intersection of management practices and athlete outcomes.

Search filters refined results to ensure relevance and quality. The date range of 20132023 captured the most recent decade of research while excluding outdated studies that might not reflect current management practices or medical knowledge. Language restrictions limited results to English to ensure accurate interpretation, while study type filters prioritized peer-reviewed empirical studies employing quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods approaches. Geographic scope focused primarily on U.S. professional sports, with selective inclusion of European and Canadian studies for comparative context. Industry focus concentrated on major professional sports leaguesespecially the NFL given its prominence in malpractice discussionswhile including NBA, MLB, and general elite athletics literature when relevant to the research questions.

## Documentation Process

### Reference Management
- Manual logging of all citations in APA format  
- Google Docs master table with relevance/quality columns

### Evidence Extraction Form
For each study, I documented:
- Full citation (APA)  
- Research design  
- Population/sample  
- Country/setting  
- Key findings  
- Effect sizes (if provided)

## Challenges and Limitations

### Search Limitations
- Few RCTs or meta-analyses specific to athlete management topics  
- Limited access to niche sports law journals without full subscription  
- NFL-focused studies dominated; fewer in NBA, MLB, or European football

### Resource Constraints
- Time limit to screen broad terms thoroughly  
- Some promising articles lacked full access despite university tools

### Topic-Specific Challenges
- Terminology was inconsistent across disciplines (e.g., “financial fragility” vs “literacy gaps”)  
- Many studies focused on problem descriptions, not interventions or outcomes
