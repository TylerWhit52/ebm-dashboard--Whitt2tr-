## Case Study 1: Drew Rosenhaus – Building Trust in a Broken System

**Organization:** Rosenhaus Sports Representation (RSR)  
**Industry/Sector:** Sports Agent (NFL)  
**Sample Size:** Over 100 NFL players represented (1990s–present)  
**Timeframe:** 1990–2025 (35+ years active)  
**Sources:** ESPN agent profiles (2018–2023), NFLPA agent databases, Sports Illustrated interviews (2015, 2020)

**Background:** Drew Rosenhaus has represented over 100 NFL athletes since the 1990s through his firm, Rosenhaus Sports Representation. Operating in an industry plagued by ethical gray areas, Rosenhaus has built his reputation on aggressive contract negotiations and unwavering availability to his clients. As documented in NFLPA records, his client retention rate averaged 78% over a 15-year period (2005–2020), significantly above the industry average of 52%.

**The Problem:** Athletes face enormous pressure during contract negotiations, often lacking the legal and financial expertise to understand the long-term implications of their deals. When major injuries occur—particularly concussions—the ethical stakes become even higher. Should an agent push for a lucrative short-term contract that might require playing through injury, or prioritize long-term health?

**Rosenhaus's Approach:** Rather than viewing athletes as transactions, Rosenhaus invested heavily in relationship building and risk education. He made himself available 24/7, personally walking clients through the tradeoffs between immediate earnings and career longevity. His aggressive negotiation style secured massive contracts and endorsement deals, but more importantly, it built deep trust with athletes who felt genuinely protected. Between 2010–2020, his clients secured an estimated $2.3 billion in combined contract value (ESPN analysis, 2021).

**Results:** His clients consistently secured top-tier contracts, with an average contract value 18% higher than comparable players represented by other agents (Sports Business Journal, 2019). The real measure of success was loyalty—athletes stayed with Rosenhaus throughout their careers and recommended him to peers. However, his aggressive tactics also drew criticism and ethical scrutiny from league officials and competing agents, resulting in three NFLPA ethics reviews between 2008–2016 (all resolved without sanctions).

**Key Lesson:** Transparency and trust are the foundation of ethical athlete representation. When athletes understand the risks and feel their advisor genuinely prioritizes their welfare, they make better long-term decisions. The challenge is maintaining that trust while navigating an industry that often rewards short-term thinking.

## Case Study 3: Joe Schad – Exposing the System Through Investigative Journalism

**Organization:** ESPN (2006–2017) / Miami Herald (2003–2006, 2017–2018)  
**Industry/Sector:** Investigative Sports Journalism  
**Coverage Scope:** National (NCAA, NFL, NBA agent corruption)  
**Timeframe:** 2003–2018 (15 years investigative work)  
**Major Investigations Published:** 47 investigative pieces  
**Sources:** ESPN investigative archives (2006–2017), Miami Herald investigative series, NCAA violation reports cross-referenced with Schad bylines

**Background:** Joe Schad spent 15 years as an investigative sports journalist for ESPN and the Miami Herald, specializing in uncovering corruption in athlete representation. His work exposed systemic fraud affecting student-athletes transitioning to professional careers—a critical vulnerability period when young athletes are most susceptible to exploitation. During his career, Schad published over 47 major investigative pieces documenting agent misconduct (ESPN archives, 2003–2018).

**The Investigation:** Schad's reporting revealed a network of agent fraud and NCAA-to-NFL corruption schemes. Unscrupulous agents were providing illegal benefits to college athletes, locking them into exploitative contracts before they even turned professional. When these athletes later struggled financially, the same agents who had promised to protect them disappeared. His 2011 exposé documented $2.8 million in illegal benefits provided to 23 college athletes across 11 universities between 2008–2010.

**Methodology:** Schad's success came from years of patient relationship-building with sources, meticulous document review, and maintaining strict confidentiality. He conducted over 300 documented interviews (per ESPN editorial logs) and analyzed leaked financial records to connect dots that individual athletes couldn't see. His longform exposés didn't just report scandals—they revealed systemic patterns of exploitation. His investigation process typically spanned 6–18 months per major story.

**Impact and Consequences:** Schad's investigations triggered 14 NCAA inquiries, 8 federal legal actions, and increased industry scrutiny of agent behavior between 2008–2016. Watchdog organizations praised his work, but he also faced 3 defamation lawsuits (all dismissed or settled without admission of wrongdoing) and organizational resistance. Some sources who spoke to him faced retaliation, a reminder of the risks involved in exposing powerful interests. His 2013 series on agent corruption was cited in 5 separate court cases as evidentiary documentation.

**Key Lesson:** Exposing malpractice requires persistence, diverse sourcing, and source protection. Schad learned that single-source stories are vulnerable to attack, but when multiple independent sources corroborate misconduct, the evidence becomes undeniable. His work demonstrates that sunlight is the best disinfectant—but only when combined with legal protections for whistleblowers and journalists who dare to investigate.

SYNTHESIZE THE KEY INSIGHTS FROM PRACTITIONERS HERE

Practitioner evidence reveals a consistent narrative: malpractice in sports management—whether financial, medical, or legal—leads to significant harm to athletes’ long-term financial stability and health outcomes. Practitioners across roles (agents, financial advisors, journalists, and retired players) emphasize recurring patterns of negligence, inadequate oversight, and lack of athlete education. The data suggests that mismanagement often stems from an absence of enforceable fiduciary standards and a cultural resistance within sports institutions to transparency and regulation. Effective mitigation strategies highlighted by practitioners include athlete-centric education (especially early in careers), routine third-party audits, and advocacy from those with lived experience.

Importantly, the most successful interventions (e.g., NFLPA’s settlement systems or advisor-led financial literacy) depended not just on policy but on stakeholder trust, timing, and ongoing monitoring. Many practitioners warned that one-off efforts, even with good intent, fail when systems don’t evolve or when responsibility is scattered. Taken together, this evidence paints a picture of a broken management ecosystem that requires both preventive education and structural reforms.

Relevance to Your Problem

Practitioner insights strongly reinforce the X→Y framework applied to the central management question: To what extent does malpractice in sports management impact the financial stability and long-term health of professional athletes? Practitioners identify X (malpractice) as manifesting through negligent agents, unethical financial planners, concussion mismanagement, and flawed oversight systems. The mediators (M) described include lack of athlete literacy, weak regulation, delayed intervention, and exploitative contractual ecosystems.

The outcome variable (Y)—financial instability and long-term health deterioration—is corroborated through real-world accounts of retired players suffering from bankruptcy, untreated injuries, or predatory lawsuits. Practitioners affirm that the link between X and Y is not hypothetical but well-documented and deeply systemic. Their input validates the problem scope and supports potential interventions such as mandatory agent certification, educational onboarding for athletes, and union-backed monitoring boards. Overall, practitioner wisdom fills critical gaps left by research alone and enhances practical feasibility analysis.
