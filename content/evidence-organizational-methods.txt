# Organizational Evidence: Internal Data Collection Strategy

## Organizational Evidence Goals

This investigation pursued two interconnected goals regarding internal organizational data. The primary goal measured internal risk factors and measurable outcomes documenting the scope of malpractice within professional sports organizations: financial misconduct including misallocated investments, fraudulent practices, and documented bankruptcies, alongside improper health management manifesting as high injury recurrence rates, delayed treatments, and inadequate protocols. The secondary goal assessed internal resource and capability availability, determining whether organizations possessed the financial resources, technical infrastructure, and institutional will to implement preventative solutions that might mitigate future malpractice.

## Data Sources and Systems

Organizations possess multiple data sources capturing malpractice dynamics and organizational capacity. Financial data includes athlete bankruptcy rates, emergency loan requests from players facing unexpected hardship, and average debt level trendscritical indicators of financial management failures. Operational metrics track incident response times (how quickly organizations address problems), athlete case resolution rates, and health outcomes including injury recurrence patterns and claims for financial hardship. Human resources data documents athlete retention and turnover, satisfaction survey scores, and post-career outcome tracking. Customer-facing metrics capture athlete experience ratings and feedback specifically regarding financial and medical support quality.

Internal systems supporting evidence collection typically include financial systems tracking contract values, disbursement records, and agent fee accountability; medical systems documenting injury reports, rehabilitation scheduling, and service provision metrics; and HR information systems maintaining salary, bonus, medical exemption, and post-career benefit data. While organizational structures vary, these core data infrastructures exist across major professional sports organizations and provide quantifiable windows into management practices and their consequences.

## Data Collection Approach

The data collection plan employed both quantitative and qualitative methods to establish comprehensive organizational understanding. Quantitative collection focused on problem-related metrics documenting malpractice: athlete bankruptcy rates (tracked through union reports and HR documentation), injury recurrence patterns (extracted from medical systems), and formal grievance reports (maintained in legal and compliance logs). Solution-related metrics measured organizational readiness: financial literacy program reach (enrollment and completion data from training records), risk protocol compliance rates (medical log documentation of adherence), and athlete support satisfaction scores (captured through surveys). Historical analysis examined trends across 510 year periods, establishing baseline conditions before policy implementation and tracking 3-year rolling averages to identify meaningful shifts in organizational practices.

Qualitative data collection complemented quantitative metrics through systematic review of internal organizational documentation: policy documents outlining medical protocols and financial counseling mandates, meeting minutes from athlete councils and compliance briefings, communication records capturing complaint patterns and feedback, and initiative reports documenting results of athlete safety and financial protection programs. Observational data collection examined process implementation: how organizations handle injury management and post-incident follow-up, timing of case escalation through organizational hierarchies, communication channels used for athlete alerts and sensitive disclosures, and cultural patterns evident in athlete-manager relationships and trust dynamics.

## Data Access and Ethical Implementation

Effective internal data gathering required careful attention to privacy, permissions, and ethical guardrails. Data custodiansincluding finance leads, medical directors, and compliance officersmaintained control over data release, requiring formal written requests, NDA amendments where applicable, and manager sign-off on access. HIPAA compliance and union player protections mandated strict confidentiality: all reporting aggregated data rather than individual case identification, with anonymized identifiers preventing athlete identification. Data security employed encrypted file storage and restricted access, limiting use to project purposes with explicit prohibition against external redistribution. Reporting boundaries presented summary statistics only, with case descriptions anonymized to prevent identifying individuals while still capturing evidence of systemic patterns.

This approach balanced the need for rigorous evidence gathering with fundamental ethical obligations to protect athlete privacy and organizational confidentiality. The resulting data provided quantifiable documentation of malpractice scope and organizational readiness for intervention, while maintaining the privacy protections essential to trusted research relationships with professional sports organizations.

## Data Analysis and Baseline Establishment

### Baseline Establishment
#### Pre-Problem Baselines
Historical data from before policy implementation (e.g. pre-2018)

#### Normal Operating Ranges
Expected ranges for re-injury, debt levels, based on athlete norms

#### Benchmark Comparisons
Compare to league-wide averages (e.g. NFL/NBA post-retirement stats)

### Problem Evidence Analysis
#### Problem Indicators
Bankruptcy, chronic injury, grievance counts

#### Problem Severity Measurement
% affected, average financial loss, years of injury-related performance loss

#### Root Cause Investigation
Cross-reference poor outcomes with internal management data

### Solution Feasibility Analysis
#### Resource Assessment
Training budgets, education staffing, athlete engagement resources

#### Capability Assessment
Past implementation success rates, technology support

#### Risk Assessment
Legal exposure, athlete non-compliance, data incompleteness

## Documentation Strategy

### Data Collection Log
Excel sheet tracking source, timeframe, contact, notes

### Analysis Documentation
Method memos, versioned scripts (Excel or Python)

### Quality Assurance
Two-stage review: completeness + validity

### Version Control
Change-tracked reports and spreadsheets

## Expected Challenges

### Data Availability
Missing older records, fragmented tracking

### Data Quality Issues
Inconsistent data labels, duplicate entries

### Access Barriers
Slow approvals, sensitive data restrictions

### Time Constraints
Delays due to privacy or holiday scheduling

## Backup Plans

### Alternative Data Sources
Union reports, insurance claim summaries

### Proxy Measures
Surveys as stand-in for unavailable financial docs

### Simplified Analysis
Case study comparison + literature benchmarks

### Organizational Evidence Acquisition Methods (ACQUIRE)

**Data Sources Identified:**
- Financial reports (pay, benefits, bonuses, grievance payments)
- Medical records (injury, treatment, clearances)
- Legal/compliance logs (malpractice reports)
- Athlete surveys
- Internal project memos (training, retirement support)

---

**Data Access and Collection Process:**
Requests will be submitted to finance and medical departments with justification. Some data will be pulled from dashboards, while others will be structured export requests. Interview requests will also go through HR and ethics approval.
