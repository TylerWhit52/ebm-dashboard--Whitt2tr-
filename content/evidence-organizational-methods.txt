# Organizational Evidence: Internal Data Collection Strategy

## Organizational Evidence Goals

This investigation pursued two interconnected goals regarding internal organizational data. The primary goal measured internal risk factors and measurable outcomes documenting the scope of malpractice within professional sports organizations: financial misconduct including misallocated investments, fraudulent practices, and documented bankruptcies, alongside improper health management manifesting as high injury recurrence rates, delayed treatments, and inadequate protocols. The secondary goal assessed internal resource and capability availability, determining whether organizations possessed the financial resources, technical infrastructure, and institutional will to implement preventative solutions that might mitigate future malpractice.

## Data Sources and Systems

Organizations possess multiple data sources capturing malpractice dynamics and organizational capacity. Financial data includes athlete bankruptcy rates, emergency loan requests from players facing unexpected hardship, and average debt level trendscritical indicators of financial management failures. Operational metrics track incident response times (how quickly organizations address problems), athlete case resolution rates, and health outcomes including injury recurrence patterns and claims for financial hardship. Human resources data documents athlete retention and turnover, satisfaction survey scores, and post-career outcome tracking. Customer-facing metrics capture athlete experience ratings and feedback specifically regarding financial and medical support quality.

Internal systems supporting evidence collection typically include financial systems tracking contract values, disbursement records, and agent fee accountability; medical systems documenting injury reports, rehabilitation scheduling, and service provision metrics; and HR information systems maintaining salary, bonus, medical exemption, and post-career benefit data. While organizational structures vary, these core data infrastructures exist across major professional sports organizations and provide quantifiable windows into management practices and their consequences.

## Data Collection Approach

The data collection plan employed both quantitative and qualitative methods to establish comprehensive organizational understanding. Quantitative collection focused on problem-related metrics documenting malpractice: athlete bankruptcy rates (tracked through union reports and HR documentation), injury recurrence patterns (extracted from medical systems), and formal grievance reports (maintained in legal and compliance logs). Solution-related metrics measured organizational readiness: financial literacy program reach (enrollment and completion data from training records), risk protocol compliance rates (medical log documentation of adherence), and athlete support satisfaction scores (captured through surveys). Historical analysis examined trends across 510 year periods, establishing baseline conditions before policy implementation and tracking 3-year rolling averages to identify meaningful shifts in organizational practices.

Qualitative data collection complemented quantitative metrics through systematic review of internal organizational documentation: policy documents outlining medical protocols and financial counseling mandates, meeting minutes from athlete councils and compliance briefings, communication records capturing complaint patterns and feedback, and initiative reports documenting results of athlete safety and financial protection programs. Observational data collection examined process implementation: how organizations handle injury management and post-incident follow-up, timing of case escalation through organizational hierarchies, communication channels used for athlete alerts and sensitive disclosures, and cultural patterns evident in athlete-manager relationships and trust dynamics.

## Data Access and Ethical Implementation

Effective internal data gathering required careful attention to privacy, permissions, and ethical guardrails. Data custodiansincluding finance leads, medical directors, and compliance officersmaintained control over data release, requiring formal written requests, NDA amendments where applicable, and manager sign-off on access. HIPAA compliance and union player protections mandated strict confidentiality: all reporting aggregated data rather than individual case identification, with anonymized identifiers preventing athlete identification. Data security employed encrypted file storage and restricted access, limiting use to project purposes with explicit prohibition against external redistribution. Reporting boundaries presented summary statistics only, with case descriptions anonymized to prevent identifying individuals while still capturing evidence of systemic patterns.

This approach balanced the need for rigorous evidence gathering with fundamental ethical obligations to protect athlete privacy and organizational confidentiality. The resulting data provided quantifiable documentation of malpractice scope and organizational readiness for intervention, while maintaining the privacy protections essential to trusted research relationships with professional sports organizations.


## Analysis and Documentation Framework

The data analysis plan employed multiple complementary approaches to establish comprehensive organizational understanding. Baseline establishment identified historical conditions before policy implementation (such as pre-2018 practices) and established normal operating ranges for metrics like injury recurrence and debt levels based on documented athlete profiles. Comparative benchmarking analyzed organizational metrics against league-wide averages in post-retirement financial stability and health outcomes, providing context for how organizational practices diverged from or aligned with industry norms.

Problem evidence analysis systematically examined documented indicatorsbankruptcy incidence, chronic injury prevalence, and grievance complaint countsto measure problem severity through quantifiable metrics: percentage of athlete population affected, average financial loss per affected individual, and years of performance loss attributable to injury-related mismanagement. Root cause investigation cross-referenced poor athlete outcomes with internal management data, investigating how specific organizational decisions or practices correlated with measurable harm.

Solution feasibility analysis assessed organizational readiness for implementing reforms: resource availability (training budgets, education staffing, athlete engagement capacity), past implementation success rates documenting organizational learning curves, technology support infrastructure, legal exposure from acknowledgment of past failures, athlete compliance patterns with organizational requirements, and data completeness enabling effective monitoring.

Documentation throughout the analysis process maintained methodological transparency: data collection logs tracked sources, timeframes, contact persons, and analytical notes; analysis documentation included method memos and versioned analysis scripts (Excel or Python); two-stage quality assurance reviews assessed both completeness and validity of documented evidence; and version control systems tracked all changes to reports and supporting materials.

Expected challenges in organizational data gathering included missing or fragmented historical records, inconsistent data labeling preventing cross-time comparison, duplicate entries from multiple systems, slow institutional approval processes, data access restrictions due to privacy requirements, and timeline delays from holiday scheduling or attorney review. Backup plans addressed these constraints: union reports and insurance claim summaries provided alternative data sources when direct organizational records proved unavailable; satisfaction surveys substituted for unavailable financial documentation; and simplified analysis frameworks employing case study comparison and literature benchmarking operated when comprehensive quantitative data remained inaccessible.
