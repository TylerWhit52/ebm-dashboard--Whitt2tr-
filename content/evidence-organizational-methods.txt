# Organizational Evidence: Internal Data Collection Strategy
# Document your approach to gathering internal organizational evidence

## Internal Evidence Goals
**Primary Goal:** Measure internal risk factors and outcomes such as financial misconduct (e.g. misallocated investments, fraud, bankruptcies) and improper health management (e.g. injury re-injury rates, delayed treatments).
**Secondary Goal:** Determine internal resource and capability availability for implementing preventative solutions to malpractice.

## Available Data Sources

### Performance Metrics/KPIs
- **Financial Data:** Athlete bankruptcy rates, emergency loan requests, average debt levels
- **Operational Data:** Incident response times, athlete case resolution rates
- **Human Resources Data:** Talent retention, turnover, athlete satisfaction survey scores
- **Customer Data:** Athlete experience ratings, feedback on financial/medical support
- **Other Relevant Metrics:** Health outcomes, injury recurrence, financial hardship claim rates

### Internal Systems
- **CRM Systems:** N/A for internal athlete data context
- **ERP Systems:** If applicable, manage scheduling and performance tracking
- **HR Information Systems:** Salary, bonuses, medical exemptions, post-career benefits
- **Financial Systems:** Contract values, disbursement records, agent fee tracking
- **Operations Systems:** Injury reporting, rehab scheduling, service provision metrics

### Reports and Documentation
- **Regular Reports:** Quarterly reports from medical/legal/finance departments
- **Survey Results:** Athlete post-retirement outcomes, satisfaction scores
- **Audit Results:** Internal malpractice investigations, compliance breaches
- **Assessment Reports:** Post-season physical reviews, contract fulfillment
- **Historical Studies:** Internal cases of mismanagement linked to financial loss/injury

## Data Collection Plan

### Quantitative Data Collection
#### Metrics to Collect

**Problem-Related Metrics:**
- Metric 1: Bankruptcy Rate - Current value: TBD - Data source: HR/Union reports
- Metric 2: Injury Recurrence - Current value: TBD - Data source: Medical systems
- Metric 3: Grievance Reports - Current value: TBD - Data source: Legal/Compliance logs

**Solution-Related Metrics:**
- Metric 1: Financial Literacy Program Reach - Baseline: TBD - Data source: Internal training records
- Metric 2: Risk Protocol Compliance Rate - Baseline: TBD - Data source: Medical logs
- Metric 3: Support Satisfaction Score - Baseline: TBD - Data source: Athlete surveys

#### Time Period Analysis
- **Historical Data Range:** Past 5–10 years
- **Trend Analysis Period:** 3-year rolling average comparisons
- **Seasonal Considerations:** Injury trends by sport season
- **Baseline Period:** 2015–2020 for pre-policy norms

### Qualitative Data Collection
#### Internal Documents Review
- **Policy Documents:** Medical protocol, financial counseling mandates
- **Meeting Minutes:** Athlete council meetings, compliance briefings
- **Communication Records:** Complaint email chains, feedback memos
- **Project Reports:** Athlete safety and finance initiative results

#### Observational Data
- **Process Observations:** Injury handling and post-game follow-up
- **Workflow Analysis:** Case escalation timing
- **Communication Patterns:** Channels used for athlete alerts
- **Cultural Observations:** Trust themes in athlete-manager relationships

## Access and Permissions

### Data Access Strategy
#### Required Permissions
- **Data Custodians:** Finance lead, medical director, compliance officer
- **Approval Process:** Written requests, NDA amendments, manager sign-off
- **Privacy Considerations:** HIPAA compliance, union protections
- **Confidentiality Requirements:** Aggregated reporting only, anonymized identifiers

#### Contact Plan
1. **Primary Contact:** Medical Director
   - **Data Sources:** Injury logs, protocol breaches
   - **Approach:** Formal request + HIPAA compliance agreement

2. **Secondary Contact:** Finance Director
   - **Data Sources:** Compensation trends, hardship claim data
   - **Approach:** Request + aggregated extract approval

### Ethical Considerations
- **Employee Privacy:** Anonymized identifiers
- **Data Security:** Secure encrypted file storage
- **Use Limitations:** Project-only access, no external redistribution
- **Reporting Boundaries:** Summary statistics only, case descriptions anonymized

## Data Analysis Plan

### Baseline Establishment
#### Pre-Problem Baselines
Historical data from before policy implementation (e.g. pre-2018)

#### Normal Operating Ranges
Expected ranges for re-injury, debt levels, based on athlete norms

#### Benchmark Comparisons
Compare to league-wide averages (e.g. NFL/NBA post-retirement stats)

### Problem Evidence Analysis
#### Problem Indicators
Bankruptcy, chronic injury, grievance counts

#### Problem Severity Measurement
% affected, average financial loss, years of injury-related performance loss

#### Root Cause Investigation
Cross-reference poor outcomes with internal management data

### Solution Feasibility Analysis
#### Resource Assessment
Training budgets, education staffing, athlete engagement resources

#### Capability Assessment
Past implementation success rates, technology support

#### Risk Assessment
Legal exposure, athlete non-compliance, data incompleteness

## Documentation Strategy

### Data Collection Log
Excel sheet tracking source, timeframe, contact, notes

### Analysis Documentation
Method memos, versioned scripts (Excel or Python)

### Quality Assurance
Two-stage review: completeness + validity

### Version Control
Change-tracked reports and spreadsheets

## Expected Challenges

### Data Availability
Missing older records, fragmented tracking

### Data Quality Issues
Inconsistent data labels, duplicate entries

### Access Barriers
Slow approvals, sensitive data restrictions

### Time Constraints
Delays due to privacy or holiday scheduling

## Backup Plans

### Alternative Data Sources
Union reports, insurance claim summaries

### Proxy Measures
Surveys as stand-in for unavailable financial docs

### Simplified Analysis
Case study comparison + literature benchmarks

### Organizational Evidence Acquisition Methods (ACQUIRE)

**Data Sources Identified:**
- Financial reports (pay, benefits, bonuses, grievance payments)
- Medical records (injury, treatment, clearances)
- Legal/compliance logs (malpractice reports)
- Athlete surveys
- Internal project memos (training, retirement support)

---

**Data Access and Collection Process:**
Requests will be submitted to finance and medical departments with justification. Some data will be pulled from dashboards, while others will be structured export requests. Interview requests will also go through HR and ethics approval.
