## Measurement Framework

### Quantitative Metrics
- Bankruptcy filings among retired athletes (target: 25% reduction within 5 years)
- Reported injury mismanagement cases (target: 40% reduction within 3 years)
- Average athlete satisfaction score with management (target: ≥4.5/5 within 3 years)
- Percentage of athletes with independent, certified financial advisors (target: 80% within 3 years)

### Qualitative Indicators
- Improved athlete confidence in management practices (survey comments)
- Enhanced trust between players, unions, and management
- Reduced negative media coverage of athlete mismanagement scandals

---

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

#### Leading Indicators (Early signals of progress)
- Number of athletes completing financial literacy programs
- Number of teams adopting certified agent/manager vetting protocols
- Usage rates of anonymous grievance or injury reporting channels

#### Lagging Indicators (Final outcomes)
- Reduction in bankruptcy filings after retirement
- Reduction in verified injury mismanagement cases
- Improvement in athlete satisfaction survey scores

---

## Baseline Measurements

### Current State Metrics
- **Metric 1:** Bankruptcy Rate = ~60% of retired athletes experience financial stress/bankruptcy (varies by league)
- **Metric 2:** Verified Mismanaged Injuries = No uniform data, but multiple high-profile cases annually
- **Metric 3:** Satisfaction with Management = ~3.5/5 average survey rating (estimated from union reports)

### Data Collection Plan
- Partner with unions to distribute anonymous surveys
- Request incident reports from leagues and player associations
- Use publicly available bankruptcy filings and lawsuits to track outcomes

---

## Success Thresholds

### Minimum Acceptable Improvement
- 10% reduction in bankruptcies and mismanaged injuries within 2 years

### Target Performance Level
- 25% reduction in bankruptcies within 5 years
- 40% reduction in injury mismanagement within 3 years
- 80% of athletes using independent advisors within 3 years

### Stretch Goal
- Achieve >50% reduction in both financial and medical malpractice indicators within 5 years
- Satisfaction ratings ≥4.8/5 across all major leagues

## Stakeholder-Specific Success Criteria

### Management Success Measures
- Reduced legal exposure, improved team reputation, and stable player performance

### Employee (Athlete) Success Measures
- Financial security, better long-term health, and improved trust in management

### Customer/Fan Success Measures
- Fewer scandals and enhanced confidence in the integrity of the sport

---

## Risk Indicators

### Red Flags
- No change in bankruptcy or injury mismanagement rates after 1–2 years
- Low participation in training or oversight programs
- Resistance from agents/managers resulting in non-compliance

### Mitigation Triggers
- Adjust oversight systems if initial uptake is low
- Increase enforcement measures or incentives for compliance
- Engage public and sponsors to pressure lagging teams/leagues

---

## Timeline for Assessment

### Short-term (30–90 days)
- Baseline surveys distributed to athletes and unions
- Compliance audit frameworks piloted

### Medium-term (3–6 months)
- Monitor early adoption metrics (training completion, reporting channel usage)
- Initial satisfaction survey follow-up

### Long-term (6–12 months and beyond)
- Track reduction trends in bankruptcy and mismanaged injury cases
- Publish first annual impact report

---

## Reporting Framework

### Dashboard Metrics
- Live metrics on athlete satisfaction, injury mismanagement, and financial security indicators

### Regular Reports
- Quarterly updates to unions, leagues, and management
- Annual public-facing impact report

### Milestone Reviews
- 6-month, 12-month, and annual reviews of all core metrics and stakeholder feedback
