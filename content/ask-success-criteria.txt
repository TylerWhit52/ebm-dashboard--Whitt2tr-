# Success Criteria Definition
# Define specific, measurable criteria to evaluate solution effectiveness

## SMART Success Criteria

### Criterion 1: Financial Stability of Athletes (Primary Outcome)
- **Specific:** Reduction in the percentage of professional athletes declaring bankruptcy within five years of retirement.
- **Measurable:** Aim for a 25% reduction in the proportion of professional athletes who experience severe financial distress or bankruptcy within 5 years. Baseline: We will determine the current percentage of retiring athletes facing financial hardship (e.g. using league data that historically around 60% of retired players encounter financial stress) as the starting point, against which the 25% drop will be measured.
- **Achievable:** Achievable through financial literacy programs, independent audits of managers, and stronger union oversight.
- **Relevant:** Directly addresses the core problem of financial harm caused by management malpractice.
- **Time-bound:** Baseline data collected within Year 1; achieve reduction within 5 years of program launch.

### Criterion 2: Health Management and Medical Oversight (Secondary Outcome)
- **Specific:** Decrease in the number of mismanaged or underreported injuries among professional athletes.
- **Measurable:** Achieve a 40% decrease in documented cases of injury mismanagement (such as concussion protocol violations or premature return-to-play decisions) over the next 3 years. Baseline: We will collaborate with medical committees to document the number of such malpractice incidents in recent seasons (using the average annual cases from the past five years as a baseline). This
- **Achievable:** Feasible with mandatory injury reporting protocols and independent medical reviews.
- **Relevant:** Addresses the long-term health consequences of management malpractice.
- **Time-bound:** Baseline metrics collected in Year 1; measurable improvements by Year 3.

### Criterion 3: Athlete Satisfaction with Management Practices (Additional Outcome)
- **Specific:** Increase in average athlete satisfaction score with management practices.
- **Measurable:** Attain an average ≥ 4.5 out of 5 satisfaction score among athletes regarding management practices within 3 years. Baseline: A comprehensive athlete survey will be conducted upfront (across teams, sports, and career stages) to establish the current average satisfaction level. That initial score — for example, if the baseline survey yields a 3.8/5 — will serve as the reference point to track progress toward the 4.5/5 target.
- **Achievable:** Realistic with enhanced transparency, independent advisory services, and new grievance channels.
- **Relevant:** Captures how reforms are perceived by athletes directly.
- **Time-bound:** Collect baseline in Year 1; reach target within 3 years.

## Measurement Framework

### Quantitative Metrics
- Bankruptcy filings among retired athletes (target: 25% reduction within 5 years)
- Reported injury mismanagement cases (target: 40% reduction within 3 years)
- Average athlete satisfaction score with management (target: ≥4.5/5 within 3 years)
- Percentage of athletes with independent, certified financial advisors (target: 80% within 3 years)

### Qualitative Indicators
- Improved athlete confidence in management practices (survey comments)
- Enhanced trust between players, unions, and management
- Reduced negative media coverage of athlete mismanagement scandals

---

### Leading vs. Lagging Indicators

#### Leading Indicators (Early signals of progress)
- Number of athletes completing financial literacy programs
- Number of teams adopting certified agent/manager vetting protocols
- Usage rates of anonymous grievance or injury reporting channels

#### Lagging Indicators (Final outcomes)
- Reduction in bankruptcy filings after retirement
- Reduction in verified injury mismanagement cases
- Improvement in athlete satisfaction survey scores

---

## Baseline Measurements

### Current State Metrics
- **Metric 1:** Bankruptcy Rate = ~60% of retired athletes experience financial stress/bankruptcy (varies by league)
- **Metric 2:** Verified Mismanaged Injuries = No uniform data, but multiple high-profile cases annually
- **Metric 3:** Satisfaction with Management = ~3.5/5 average survey rating (estimated from union reports)

### Data Collection Plan
- Partner with unions to distribute anonymous surveys
- Request incident reports from leagues and player associations
- Use publicly available bankruptcy filings and lawsuits to track outcomes

---

## Success Thresholds

### Minimum Acceptable Improvement
- 10% reduction in bankruptcies and mismanaged injuries within 2 years

### Target Performance Level
- 25% reduction in bankruptcies within 5 years
- 40% reduction in injury mismanagement within 3 years
- 80% of athletes using independent advisors within 3 years

### Stretch Goal
- Achieve >50% reduction in both financial and medical malpractice indicators within 5 years
- Satisfaction ratings ≥4.8/5 across all major leagues

## Stakeholder-Specific Success Criteria

### Management Success Measures
- Reduced legal exposure, improved team reputation, and stable player performance

### Employee (Athlete) Success Measures
- Financial security, better long-term health, and improved trust in management

### Customer/Fan Success Measures
- Fewer scandals and enhanced confidence in the integrity of the sport

---

## Risk Indicators

### Red Flags
- No change in bankruptcy or injury mismanagement rates after 1–2 years
- Low participation in training or oversight programs
- Resistance from agents/managers resulting in non-compliance

### Mitigation Triggers
- Adjust oversight systems if initial uptake is low
- Increase enforcement measures or incentives for compliance
- Engage public and sponsors to pressure lagging teams/leagues

---

## Timeline for Assessment

### Short-term (30–90 days)
- Baseline surveys distributed to athletes and unions
- Compliance audit frameworks piloted

### Medium-term (3–6 months)
- Monitor early adoption metrics (training completion, reporting channel usage)
- Initial satisfaction survey follow-up

### Long-term (6–12 months and beyond)
- Track reduction trends in bankruptcy and mismanaged injury cases
- Publish first annual impact report

---

## Reporting Framework

### Dashboard Metrics
- Live metrics on athlete satisfaction, injury mismanagement, and financial security indicators

### Regular Reports
- Quarterly updates to unions, leagues, and management
- Annual public-facing impact report

### Milestone Reviews
- 6-month, 12-month, and annual reviews of all core metrics and stakeholder feedback

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Be specific and measurable - avoid vague terms like "better" or "improved"
2. Ensure criteria are achievable given your resources and timeline
3. Include both quantitative and qualitative measures
4. Consider different stakeholder perspectives on success
5. Plan how you'll actually collect the measurement data
