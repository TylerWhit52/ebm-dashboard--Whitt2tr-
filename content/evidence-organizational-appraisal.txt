# Organizational Evidence: Quality Appraisal

## Overall Organizational Evidence Quality Rating
**Rating:** Medium
**Confidence Level:** Moderate confidence in the internal evidence, given triangulation across HR, financial, and operations reports, despite minor data quality limitations.

## Individual Source Quality Assessment

### Source 1: Financial Systems – Athlete Bankruptcy, Debt Levels, Emergency Loans
#### Data Quality Dimensions
- **Data Collection Rigor:** Good – based on structured financial reporting systems and verified agent contract records
- **Completeness:** Medium – covers ~80% of active and recently retired athletes but misses some under temporary financial monitoring
- **Accuracy:** High – formal audit procedures applied quarterly
- **Timeliness:** Medium – updated quarterly, may lag real-time changes

#### Relevance and Usefulness
- **Problem Relevance:** High – core to understanding financial instability
- **Solution Relevance:** Medium – flags risk but not root causes
- **Limitations:** No behavioral or context-based data on decision-making patterns

---

### Source 2: HR Systems – Athlete Satisfaction, Talent Turnover, Benefit Utilization
#### Data Quality Dimensions
- **Data Collection Rigor:** Medium – survey fatigue reduces response rates (~60%)
- **Completeness:** Medium – some departments have missing data from select quarters
- **Accuracy:** Fair – self-reported measures vulnerable to bias
- **Timeliness:** High – updated annually and after each season end

#### Relevance and Usefulness
- **Problem Relevance:** High – direct link to athlete dissatisfaction and retention
- **Solution Relevance:** High – shows where wellness and HR investment may increase impact
- **Limitations:** Subjective data, potential reporting bias

---

### Source 3: Operational Reports – Injury Recurrence, Case Resolution Timelines
#### Data Quality Dimensions
- **Data Collection Rigor:** Excellent – drawn from digital injury management logs
- **Completeness:** High – near 100% capture of athlete physical and treatment episodes
- **Accuracy:** High – reviewed by case managers weekly
- **Timeliness:** High – updated within 72 hours post-incident

#### Relevance and Usefulness
- **Problem Relevance:** High – exposes lagging resolution time and injury mismanagement
- **Solution Relevance:** High – useful for targeting intervention bottlenecks
- **Limitations:** Focused on post-injury stage, not preemptive prevention

---

### Source 4: Internal Survey Reports – Post-Retirement Outcome Surveys
#### Data Quality Dimensions
- **Data Collection Rigor:** Fair – response rate low (~40%), often convenience-based
- **Completeness:** Low – incomplete coverage of older retired players
- **Accuracy:** Medium – retrospective self-reporting challenges
- **Timeliness:** Low – fielded only every 3 years

#### Relevance and Usefulness
- **Problem Relevance:** Medium – reveals outcomes but not processes
- **Solution Relevance:** Low – cannot directly inform specific program design
- **Limitations:** Gaps in sampling, recency, and accuracy

---

## Systemic Biases and Structural Limitations
- **Response Bias:** Moderate – self-report tools vulnerable to over-/under-reporting
- **Sampling Gaps:** Yes – especially among athletes not currently affiliated with major programs
- **System Integration Issues:** Data from HR and finance not fully cross-linked, limiting pattern detection
- **Data Timeliness Lag:** Especially in financial recovery and post-career outcomes

---

## Evidence Strength Assessment
- **Quantity of Evidence:** Adequate – six+ integrated internal sources
- **Triangulation:** Strong – multiple sources (HR, ops, finance, legal) point to same underlying risks
- **Trend Consistency:** Medium – consistent across 2+ years of reports but with some seasonal variation
- **Directness of Metrics:** Mixed – direct on outcome impact (e.g., injury recurrence) but indirect on root causes

---

## Confidence in Organizational Evidence
### For Problem Definition
- **Evidence Strength:** Strong
- **Confidence Level:** High
- **Limitations:** Some blind spots in qualitative context and in off-cycle athletes

### For Solution Feasibility
- **Evidence Strength:** Moderate
- **Confidence Level:** Medium
- **Limitations:** Readiness indicators and process improvement attempts only partially documented

---

## Internal Evidence Gaps and Needs
- **Missing Segments:** Athletes without agents or those in semi-pro leagues underrepresented
- **Behavioral Insights:** Lacking root-cause analysis from decision-making behavior or interviews
- **Feedback Systems:** No real-time feedback loops or dashboards to monitor wellness metrics in-season
- **Cross-Departmental Linkages:** Weak coordination between finance, HR, and medical process data

---

## Implications for Decision-Making
- **Weight of Organizational Evidence:** Significant – establishes a clear internal pattern of breakdowns
- **Limitations to Compensate For:** Must be paired with scientific research (meta-analyses, implementation guides)
- **Next Steps:** Combine these insights with stakeholder input and scientific recommendations for well-rounded interventions
