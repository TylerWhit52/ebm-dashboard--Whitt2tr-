- Variation in athlete backgrounds and support networks

---

### Evidence Gaps
- Lack of RCTs on intervention effectiveness
- Minimal evidence from non-football professional sports
- Few long-term studies tracking post-retirement outcomes

---

## Synthesis for Decision Making

### Strength of Evidence
**For Problem Existence:** Strong

## Scientific Evidence Interpretation (INTERPRET)

**Summary of Findings:**
These studies collectively show that professional athletes face high risk of financial and health harm due to systemic mismanagement, lack of transparency, and insufficient education. Effect sizes from financial literacy and mental health studies show moderate to strong positive impact when preventive strategies are applied.

**Interpretation for Your Context:**
The X → Y relationship (“management malpractice” → “worse financial/health outcomes”) is well-supported by the evidence. Effect sizes (e.g., r = .52, d = .58) suggest that well-implemented reforms could substantially improve athlete outcomes, validating your project direction.
