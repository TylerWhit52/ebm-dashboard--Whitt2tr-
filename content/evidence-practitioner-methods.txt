# Practitioner Evidence: Methods & Acquisition Strategy

## Practitioner Evidence Goals

This investigation pursued two interconnected goals in gathering practitioner evidence. The primary goal sought to understand how malpractice in sports managementparticularly financial misguidance and medical neglectis experienced and perceived by professionals with direct exposure to these problems. Rather than relying solely on research literature, this approach captured tacit knowledge about the realities of athlete management that published studies might miss. The secondary goal worked to identify practitioner-informed strategies that have proven effective in preventing or mitigating athlete exploitation and long-term harm, drawing on decades of accumulated experience from those working within the system.

## Target Practitioners and Identification Strategy

The evidence gathering strategy targeted industry experts with direct experience in the professional sports ecosystem: retired or active professionals in sports agency, league governance, athlete development, and medical or legal advisory roles. The target profile prioritized practitioners with 725 years of experience across major professional leagues (NFL, NBA, MLB), sports law, and sports medicine, working at organizations ranging from small specialist firms to major league structures. Geographic focus remained primarily U.S.-based while remaining open to international comparisons that might illuminate universal patterns in athlete management.

Specific practitioners were identified based on their demonstrated public engagement with athlete welfare issues. Joe Linta, an NFL agent at JL Sports, was selected for his public advocacy on contract fairness and athlete career longevityhis perspectives accessible through podcast appearances and media interviews. Dr. Robert Cantu, a neurosurgeon and leading CTE researcher, provided critical insights into medical literature and policy shifts around sports-related brain trauma, drawn from his published interviews, white papers, and conference materials. David Cornwell, a sports attorney specializing in cases involving institutional negligence against athletes, contributed legal and systemic perspectives through legal publications, op-eds, and public lectures. These practitioners were selected not through direct contact but through analysis of their publicly available commentary and documented case work.

## Evidence Acquisition Methods

Practitioner insights were gathered exclusively through high-quality secondary materials rather than original interviews. This approach involved systematic analysis of in-depth practitioner interviews published in professional outlets, long-form industry profiles in respected publications, expert commentary and panel transcripts from professional conferences, and detailed case studies examining specific management failures and reform efforts. Sources included professional news outlets (ESPN, The Athletic), sports law journals, player association publications, and reputable long-form podcasts and investigative reports known for rigorous vetting and expert access.

Case study research followed a targeted indexing strategy, prioritizing published case studies from high-credibility sources including The Athletic, Sports Illustrated, Harvard Business Review (sports coverage), and LawInSport. Search strategy organized cases by specific topic domains: concussion litigation and medical mismanagement, athlete bankruptcy prevention and financial education, and documented management malpractice with visible consequences. Key takeaways from each case were documented in a standardized table format capturing source URLs, relevance to the malpractice problem, practitioner quoted, and specific mitigation strategies discussed. Target organizations included the NFLPA, Rosenhaus Sports Representation, Steinberg Sports, and organizations like the Athlete Recovery Fund, with insights drawn exclusively from official publications, policy whitepapers, ESPN features, and vetted journalism rather than direct solicitation.

## Documentation and Source Tracking

All practitioner evidence underwent rigorous documentation to ensure reproducibility and traceability. Case studies were summarized using a consistent template capturing organization, relevance to the malpractice problem, practitioner perspectives quoted, root problems identified, measurable evidence of impact, solutions attempted, and stakeholders affected. Each source received APA-style citation alongside archival notation for source reproducibility, allowing future researchers to verify findings against the original materials. This documentation approach balanced the need for efficiency (analyzing secondary sources rather than conducting time-intensive original interviews) with methodological rigor (transparent sourcing and standardized extraction).

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Start outreach early - practitioners are busy and may take time to respond
2. Be professional and clear about your academic purpose
3. Prepare thoroughly for interviews to make the most of practitioners' time
4. Have backup sources in case your primary targets aren't available
5. Consider offering something valuable in return for their time
