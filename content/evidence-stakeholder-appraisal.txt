# Stakeholder Evidence: Quality Assessment 

## Representativeness & Sampling Bias
Our stakeholder evidence draws heavily from NFL-related sources because the NFL has the most publicly available data on injuries, lawsuits, and financial outcomes. This gives us strong material, but it also means our sample leans toward **male, professional, U.S.-based athletes**. Experiences from Olympic athletes, women’s leagues, or non-American sports were not captured as directly.  

We also recognize a **survivorship and visibility bias**: people with severe injuries, financial losses, or negative experiences are more likely to speak publicly. Their stories are real and important, but they can overshadow those who left the sport relatively healthy or stable. We attempted balance by including the limited positive or neutral perspectives available (e.g., players noting improvements in protocols, or management highlighting benefits), but the evidence still skews toward stakeholders reporting problems.

## Credibility & Triangulation
We prioritized established, credible sources — union surveys, investigative journalism, legal filings, and major news outlets. Many of these sources consistently reinforce one another. For example, long-term health issues reported in ESPN/KFF surveys align with lawsuit testimony and union statements. The NFLPA distrust statistic (78%) appears repeatedly across independent reports.  

Where statistics were widely cited but debated (e.g., early high bankruptcy rates), we acknowledged the limitations and referenced more recent studies showing lower numbers. Cross-checking each claim against multiple sources helped ensure the evidence we used is **coherent, consistent, and realistic**, even though it is delivered as simulated stakeholder feedback.

## Bias & Perspective
Each stakeholder group has predictable biases.  
- **Players and retirees** emphasize harms and may generalize from personal experiences.  
- **Unions** push for stronger protections, sometimes highlighting worst-case scenarios to advocate for change.  
- **Management and league officials** tend to minimize systemic issues and frame problems as isolated incidents.  

We intentionally included **both supportive and opposing narratives** to identify where perspectives diverge and where they overlap. Understanding the motivations behind each source — whether emotional, strategic, or defensive — helped us weigh the evidence fairly. No single perspective was taken at face value; instead, each was evaluated in context.

## Consistency & Convergence
Across almost all sources, certain themes show strong convergence:
- Distrust of team-provided medical care  
- Pressure to play through injuries  
- Significant post-career health challenges  
- High exposure to financial mismanagement  
- Frustration with navigating benefits systems  

These recurring patterns across different groups suggest the issues are **systemic rather than anecdotal**. While some counterexamples exist — such as athletes reporting positive care or management highlighting improvements — these are comparatively rare. Their presence is still useful, as it shows that not every case is negative, but the overall consistency strengthens the validity of the broader themes.

## Completeness & Limitations
Because we relied entirely on public, secondary data, some nuances are inevitably missing. We couldn’t ask follow-up questions, clarify contradictions, or gather deeper insights from quieter stakeholder groups like team doctors or medical staff.  

Some data points are also several years old. While we incorporated recent reports and updated findings, certain conditions may have improved (e.g., concussion protocols, benefits changes), and our evidence may underrepresent those improvements.  

Still, the persistence of similar issues in **recent** sources suggests that the core concerns remain relevant and that older data still reflects ongoing problems.

## Usefulness & Actionability
Despite limitations, the stakeholder evidence is highly useful for this project. It directly speaks to the **extent and nature** of malpractice impacts — offering both concrete quantitative indicators (e.g., distrust percentages, injury outcomes, financial loss estimates) and rich narratives explaining *why* athletes feel at risk.  

The evidence is particularly strong for identifying:
- where trust breaks down  
- what players and unions want changed  
- which policies are failing  
- where management and athletes disagree  
- what solutions stakeholders consider legitimate  

While it cannot provide precise causal statistics on every outcome, it is well suited for understanding **perceptions, patterns, and real-world consequences**, which is exactly what stakeholder evidence is meant to capture.

## Overall Assessment
Overall, the stakeholder evidence is **credible, well-aligned across multiple independent sources, and strong enough to confidently inform conclusions** about how malpractice affects athletes. It contains biases and gaps, but these were identified, accounted for, and balanced through triangulation.  

The evidence consistently highlights systemic issues tied to health management, financial oversight, and post-career support. While our sample is NFL-heavy and may emphasize more negative voices, the patterns are supported by diverse sources and remain highly relevant.  

In short, the stakeholder evidence is **trustworthy, robust, and actionable**, providing a realistic and nuanced foundation for understanding how sports management malpractice shapes athlete health and financial stability — and offering a solid base for developing meaningful recommendations.
