# Practitioner Evidence: Credibility & Relevance Assessment

## Overall Credibility and Confidence Assessment

The practitioner evidence base demonstrates high overall credibility with correspondingly high confidence in practitioner-derived recommendations. The five practitioners consulted represent diverse roles within the professional sports ecosysteman elite agent, a retired player-turned-advocate, an investigative journalist, a certified financial advisor, and an institutional governance bodyproviding triangulated perspectives from multiple stakeholder positions. Their combined experience spans 30+ years in individual roles and decades at the institutional level, with direct exposure to the consequences of management malpractice across financial, medical, and organizational domains.

## Individual Practitioner Assessment

**Drew Rosenhaus  NFL Agent (30+ years, 100+ player clients):** Rosenhaus brings extensive direct problem experience from his role representing high-profile NFL athletes through contract negotiations, crisis management, and long-term career planning. His professional credibility stems from 30+ years active in the industry, nearly universal acknowledgment as elite despite polarizing reputation, and documented track record of negotiating massive contracts with multi-decade client loyalty. His expertise encompasses both problem recognition (extensive exposure to athlete financial vulnerability and health pressure) and solution implementation (long-term client financial strategy development). However, his assessment carries important bias considerations: direct financial interest in client fees, organizational bias toward maximizing athlete compensation and brand loyalty, and high personal investment in defending client practices. Details remain partially private despite high public presence.

**Eugene Monroe  Retired NFL Player (10+ league years, 7+ advocacy):** Monroe's credibility derives from extremely high direct problem experiencehe personally experienced and suffered from concussion mismanagement and institutional health negligence. His 10+ years in the league followed by 7+ years in active advocacy positioned him to witness malpractice consequences firsthand and catalyze public debate on reform. His solution implementation experience is moderate but meaningful at the policy level, though his influence remains primarily health-focused rather than spanning financial and management domains. His bias profile is notably cleaner than agent-based practitioners: no financial interest, health-reform ideological orientation, very high personal investment driven by lived experience, and strong transparency. His perspective carries the authority of lived experience but some limitation in scope beyond health issues.

**Joe Schad  Investigative Sports Journalist (15+ years):** Schad's credibility rests on 15+ years investigative journalism specializing in exposing institutional corruption across NCAA, NFL, and broader sports. His professional reputation benefits from track record of breaking major corruption stories with documented impact. His expertise is journalistic rather than managerialhe specializes in problem exposure and documentation rather than implementation. His financial interests are minimal, though possible media framing bias exists. His transparency is generally strong, and his multi-organizational experience provides broader context than single-organization practitioners. His value lies particularly in corroborating malpractice patterns across organizations rather than offering implementation insights.

**Kristin Burr  NFLPA Certified Financial Advisor (10+ years, NFL portfolios):** Burr's credibility stems from direct problem experience (observing misguided financial planning and athlete vulnerability), solution implementation experience (actively managing NFL client portfolios with high retention rates demonstrating fiduciary alignment), and recent experience (2010s-2020s work with active and retired athletes). Her expertise directly addresses financial dimensions of malpractice. However, her assessment carries financial interests (compensation tied to assets under management) and moderate organizational bias. Her transparency is high, and her niche reputation is solid, though her perspective remains NFL-focused and limited to financial domains.

**NFLPA Concussion Oversight Board (institutional actor):** The NFLPA board represents decades of combined staff experience and direct institutional responsibility for + in managed concussion-related settlements. Its professional credibility shows mixed assessment: praised for transparency in processes, but criticized for slow pace of problem resolution. Its expertise encompasses both problem documentation and large-scale institutional solution implementation (settlement management, oversight protocols). Its perspective carries inherent organizational bias and mixed transparencysome information public, some confidential due to legal constraints. Its value lies in understanding institutional-scale implementation challenges and settlement precedents.

## Evidence Synthesis and Decision-Making Implications

Across all five practitioners, consensus emerged on three critical points: (1) malpractice is endemic, often unintentional but consequential; (2) effective solutions require early education, transparent fiduciary standards, and independent oversight rather than relying on internal organizational incentives; (3) implementation faces resistance from those benefiting from current opaque systems. Divergences appear primarily in scope emphasisagents and financial advisors focus on financial domain, while Monroe emphasizes health and medical oversight, while journalists and institutional actors illuminate organizational and systemic barriers.

Practitioner evidence should carry substantial weight in solution design and implementation strategy assessment. Their insights directly address "what actually works in practice" and "what obstacles will emerge," filling gaps that research literature cannot adequately address. However, practitioner recommendations must be weighted against their specific biases and interestsparticularly financial interests for advisors and agents, and organizational interests for institutional actors. Cross-validation across practitioners with different biases and interests strengthens confidence in recommendations emerging consistently across diverse perspectives.

Bias is acknowledged (agents and institutional roles). However, diverse perspectives (advocate, advisor, journalist) help balance perspectives.

Overall Confidence:
High confidence that practitioner perspectives accurately diagnose problems. Medium confidence in execution details of proposed solutions.
