Critical Appraisal of Practitioner Evidence (CRITICALLY APPRAISE)

Credibility Assessment:
All five practitioners or cases are directly relevant and highly credible in their domains. While financial and ideological biases exist, their insights align with observable patterns in athlete management failures.

Identifying Potential Biases:
Bias is acknowledged (agents and institutional roles). However, diverse perspectives (advocate, advisor, journalist) help balance perspectives.

Overall Confidence:
High confidence that practitioner perspectives accurately diagnose problems. Medium confidence in execution details of proposed solutions.
