# Assessment: Monitoring & Evaluation Plan
# Systematic approach to measuring implementation success and organizational impact
## Evaluation Framework Overview

### Evaluation Questions
**Primary Evaluation Question:** To what extent does implementing structured support and oversight programs reduce long-term financial instability and injury recurrence among professional athletes?

**Secondary Evaluation Questions:**
1. How effective are the implemented solutions in improving post-career financial stability?
2. How efficiently are athlete rehabilitation and recovery processes managed post-implementation?
3. Are key stakeholders (athletes, agents, managers) satisfied with the support interventions?
4. What unintended consequences, positive or negative, emerge from the program?

### Evaluation Approach
**Evaluation Type:** Formative (during implementation) and Summative (after completion)  
**Evaluation Design:** Before-and-after comparison with stakeholder triangulation and case study overlays  
**Mixed Methods Approach:** Integrated use of internal financial/medical metrics and stakeholder qualitative feedback
