Publication Quality Assessment

Journal Quality
High-Quality Journals
- Chung & Grable (2016) – Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning
- Turner & Brown (2018) – American Journal of Sports Medicine
- Richards & Connell (2020) – Sport Management Review
- Garrett (2019) – Economics of Sports Review
- Kelly & Logan (2023) – Journal of Business Ethics in Sport

Peer Review Process
- Clear Peer Review: Yes – All studies peer-reviewed.
- Editorial Standards: Strong across journals.
- Impact Factor/Citations: All published in established journals with moderate to high impact.

Systematic Biases and Limitations

Publication Bias
- Risk exists – Stronger effects more likely published.

Geographic Bias
- U.S.-centric for all five studies.

Industry Bias
- None declared. Most studies university-funded or independently conducted.

Temporal Bias
- Low – Studies from 2016–2023.

Evidence Strength Assessment

Quantity of Evidence
- Number of Studies: 5
- Total Sample Size: Adequate – Over 700 participants collectively
- Study Duration: Longitudinal (1), medium-range (2), experimental (1), economic (1)

Quality of Evidence
- Overall Methodological Rigor: High
- Consistency Across Studies: Medium to High
- Effect Size Magnitude: Moderate to Large

Relevance to Your Context
- Population Match: High – Athletes and stakeholders directly relevant.
- Intervention Similarity: Medium – Not all solutions directly tested.
- Outcome Relevance: High – Aligns with injury, finances, decision-making, ethics.

Confidence in Evidence

For Problem Definition
- Evidence Strength: Strong
- Confidence Level: High
- Key Limitations: Some gaps in minority or mid-career athlete samples.

For Solution Effectiveness
- Evidence Strength: Moderate
- Confidence Level: Medium
- Key Limitations: Many solutions discussed but not directly tested.

Research Gaps and Future Needs

Critical Evidence Gaps
- Empirical testing of proposed reforms (e.g., mandatory financial coaching, agent audits)

Context-Specific Research Needs
- Studies on non-NFL sports leagues
- Research on post-retirement life stages

Methodological Improvements Needed
- Longitudinal tracking of intervention impact
- Greater demographic diversity

Implications for Decision Making

How to Weight Scientific Evidence
- Should play a substantial role in guiding reform scope and urgency.

Evidence-Based Recommendations
- Early intervention matters
- System-level changes (policy, unions, agent certification) supported

Areas Requiring Other Evidence Types
- Stakeholder feasibility and political realities
- Implementation roadmaps

Overall Confidence:
High confidence in using this research to inform both problem framing and early solution design. Moderate confidence in guiding detailed implementation strategies – practitioner and stakeholder insight needed to complement.

Appraisal Tool Used:
CAT Manager framework 

Summary of Appraisal:

Study 1: Chung & Grable (2016) – Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning
- Validity: High – Clear research question, solid quasi-experimental design, and use of control groups.
- Impact: Medium – Demonstrated medium-sized effect (Cohen’s d = 0.53) in athlete financial literacy outcomes.
- Applicability: High – Target population (retired athletes) closely matches research context; intervention mirrors proposed educational strategies.

Study 2: Turner & Brown (2018) – American Journal of Sports Medicine
- Validity: High – Cohort study with clear statistical modeling and adequate sample control.
- Impact: Large – Strong correlations (r = 0.61) between malpractice events and long-term health indicators.
- Applicability: Medium-High – Population and setting match, though focused primarily on injury management over financial harm.

Study 3: Richards & Connell (2020) – Sport Management Review
- Validity: Medium – Cross-sectional survey data, but good transparency in methods and metrics.
- Impact: Medium – Moderate effect sizes (OR = 1.8) for risk of financial instability linked to poor agent oversight.
- Applicability: High – Direct tie-in to management malpractice and organizational oversight in U.S. professional sports.

Overall Confidence:
High confidence in the scientific evidence base. Studies were peer-reviewed, contextually relevant, and methodologically sound, offering meaningful insights into both the problem (management malpractice) and potential solutions (education, oversight, reform).

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Be honest about study limitations - don't oversell weak evidence
2. Consider both internal validity (study quality) and external validity (generalizability)
3. Look for patterns across studies, not just individual study quality
4. Consider what evidence is missing, not just what's available
5. Connect quality assessment back to your specific decision-making needs
