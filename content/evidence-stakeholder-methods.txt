# Stakeholder Evidence: Methods & Engagement Strategy

## How We Collected Stakeholder Input
Instead of interviewing athletes or team staff directly, we relied on public, first-hand material that already exists — things like surveys, athlete interviews, legal filings, podcasts, panel discussions, and even Reddit AMAs where former athletes talk honestly about their experiences.

One useful example was an NFLPA health and safety survey showing that 78% of players don’t trust team doctors. We also looked at stories from retired players and testimonies from lawsuits. In one high-profile case, former NFL players said team doctors were financially rewarded for denying injury claims.

Using this type of evidence let us get genuine stakeholder viewpoints without pretending to collect “new” data. Everything we used was publicly available and ethically safe — no deception, no privacy issues, just real voices already out there.

## Who We Considered Stakeholders & How We Sampled Them
To understand how sports-management malpractice harms athletes, we pulled in perspectives from a mix of groups: current players, retired players, unions, team executives, agents, medical staff, and fans/media.

We didn’t try to be fully “random.” Instead, we chose representative sources from each group. For example:
- Statements from the NFLPA president to represent the organized player voice.
- Interviews with retired athletes discussing long-term injuries and financial struggles.
- Comments from agents/financial advisors who’ve seen players get taken advantage of.
- League office press conferences to see how management frames these issues.

Think of it like running a “virtual” focus group using real public sources. It gave us a balanced mix of views without crossing ethical lines.

## What Each Stakeholder Group Thinks (and Why it Matters)

### Current & Former Players
These are the people most affected, so their perspective matters the most.
Interest: Extremely high.
Power: Medium on their own, higher when organized.

Active players often don’t feel comfortable calling out their teams, but retired players speak much more openly. Many describe feeling disposable — one former NFL player said the league acts like it cares when cameras are rolling, but not afterward. Their experiences give the issue real emotional weight and make it clear why malpractice is such a problem.

### Players’ Unions
Unions fight for players’ safety, benefits, and long-term health.
Interest: Very high.
Power: High.

They regularly call out conflicts of interest — for example, concerns about team doctors not being independent. They also highlight how leagues tend to prioritize revenue first. Their public statements helped us understand the organized, policy-focused side of the issue.

### Team Owners & League Executives
Owners and league officials care deeply about money, reputation, and avoiding scandals.
Interest: High for business reasons, lower for long-term player welfare.
Power: Extremely high.

Commissioners often emphasize how much support leagues *claim* to offer, but other evidence shows management sometimes hides or downplays medical issues to avoid cost. Reviewing this group’s statements helped us see how they justify current policies and where resistance to reform might come from.

### Sports Agents & Financial Advisors
These people influence players’ contracts and financial decisions.
Interest: Mixed — some protect players, others exploit them.
Power: Moderate.

Players often trust advisors with everything, which makes financial exploitation dangerous. Between 2004–2017, athletes lost around $500 million to advisor fraud. This helped us see how poor oversight can destroy financial stability long after an athlete retires.

### Medical Staff (Team Doctors & Trainers)
They’re supposed to protect athletes — but they’re also hired by the team.
Interest: High professionally, but loyalty can be conflicted.
Power: Moderate.

The conflict of interest is a big reason so many players say they don’t trust team medical staff. We also looked at malpractice cases, including huge settlements for negligent surgeries. These patterns show how medical decisions can be influenced by team priorities, not patient health.

### Fans & Media
They’re not directly affected, but they shape public pressure.
Interest: Medium.
Power: Indirect but strong when public sentiment shifts.

Fans and journalists push leagues to act when something tragic or unfair happens. Their voices help frame the issue as a moral one — not just a business one.

## Ethical Approach & How We Analyzed the Data
Everything we used came from the public domain — no sensitive data, no personal contact, no ethical risks. We cross-checked claims wherever possible to avoid relying on a single biased source. When players mentioned struggles, we matched those stories against independent medical studies.

Using this method gave us a reliable picture of how malpractice affects athletes’ health and finances while still respecting every stakeholder’s privacy. It also helped us build a long-term, ethical understanding of the issue without pretending we gathered new data ourselves.
